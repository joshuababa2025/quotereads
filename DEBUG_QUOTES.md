# Debug Information

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Delete Button Now Shows**
- Fixed MyQuotes to use UserQuoteCard for user's own quotes in both "All" tab and "Posted" tab
- Delete button appears in 3-dots menu for user's own quotes
- Added toast notifications for success/error

### 2. **Quote Details Page**
- Enhanced to handle both static quotes and database quotes
- Improved URL parsing for friendly URLs
- Added proper error handling and loading states

## Database Structure:
```sql
-- quotes table
CREATE TABLE public.quotes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  author TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  is_hidden BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## URL Format:
- Friendly: `/quote/first-six-words-author-name-uuid8chars`
- Direct: `/quote/full-uuid`

## Test Steps:
1. Go to /my-quotes
2. Click "Posted" tab
3. Look for 3-dots menu on your quotes
4. Click "Delete Quote" option
5. Click on any quote to test details page

## If Still Not Working:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user is logged in
- Check if quotes exist in database
- Test with a simple UUID URL first
