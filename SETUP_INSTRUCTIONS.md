## Step 1: Run Database Schema (REQUIRED)

**You must run these SQL files in Supabase SQL Editor before the system will work:**

### 1. Run BOOKS_SCHEMA.sql
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of BOOKS_SCHEMA.sql into Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

### 2. Run ADDITIONAL_FEATURES_SCHEMA.sql  
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of ADDITIONAL_FEATURES_SCHEMA.sql into Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

## Step 2: Add Sample Data

After running the schemas, go to `/admin/books` and add:

## Current Issues:

1. **"No chapters available"** = Database tables don't exist yet
2. **"Content not found"** = No data in database yet

## After Setup:
- `/chapters-preview` will show real chapters
- `/book/{id}` will show real book details
- Admin panel will work properly
